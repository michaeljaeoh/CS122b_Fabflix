USE DOM PARSER

Optimization 1: parse xml file one by one, 
then write the meaningfull data to .txt with field seperated by '|'
This will reduce the memory use, and import parsing speed.
Later on, the .txt file can be use to improve insert into database.

Optimization 2: use LOAD LOCAL INFILE to speed up insert into tables in database.
Use INSERT FROM JOIN to insert data to linked table.
